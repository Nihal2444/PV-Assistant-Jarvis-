This is an AI Assistant created by me . 

contains 4 files : 
        -> teachmymodel.py  : you can use this code of file to teach things to your AI .
        -> model_memory.json   : this is the "memory"  where all the things that you have taught to AI is stored.
        -> model_test.py : this is the file of code where you can speak with AI , and check if the AI is able to recognise things that you have thought .
        -? Task Automations.py : this is the code file that triggers the automatiions . ( Example : Just say please open youtube, then it replies "Opening youtube.." and youtube is opened  )
